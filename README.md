## Tech Stack

Ruby, RSpec, Sinatra, Capybara, HTML & CSS

## Building Process

I want to build this web application to remind myself how to build a full stack web application in Ruby.

I have set myself some simple user stories which I know I can complete quite easily to get myself started. But the later user stories and the stretch goals start to touch onto things I have not done before.

I have decided that this project is very similar to those of some fo the projects I did during makers academy. Especially the [Bookmark Manager](https://github.com/cdunham1989/bookmark-manager) application.

Therefore I am going to move on to something a bit more in depth and work on something to prepare me for interview style tech tests.

## Using the application

Run `rake setup` to setup the project as intended. This will create the necessary databases and tables.
